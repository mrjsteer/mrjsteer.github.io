            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Mr. Steer is a teacher who loves what he does. He teaches maths, economics, and business studies in different schools around the world. Since March 2024, he's taught in five schools. Some students call him Mr. Steer, while others think "Mr. J" sounds cooler, and he's okay with that! His teaching journey began when he helped younger students while he was still in school himself. He found he enjoyed it, especially when it came to maths. Teaching this subject just made sense to him. Moving from one school to another has been an exciting adventure for Mr. Steer. Each school brings new challenges and opportunities, from the UK to places far away. He loves experiencing different cultures and ways of teaching. In his classrooms, Mr. Steer has had some really special moments. When his Year 8 students, who aced an IGCSE paper, stand as a testament to his dedication and their hard work. or when he started a YouTube channel during the pandemic. He also cherishes simple things, like getting thank-you cards from students and enjoying sports events. Mr. Steer's teaching ethos is a tapestry woven with innovative strategies and unwavering commitment. From Retrieval Starter Grids to differentiated worksheets, he crafts engaging lessons that cater to diverse learning needs. Armed with mini whiteboards and targeted questions, his classrooms buzz with curiosity and intellectual vigour. Navigating the intricate web of teaching responsibilities across multiple subjects and schools demands finesse and resourcefulness. Yet, Mr Steer finds solace in technology, leveraging platforms like Mathswatch to streamline assessment and focus on personalised feedback. Challenges may arise, but Mr. Steer confronts them with resilience and empathy. Whether tackling behaviour management issues or navigating bureaucratic hurdles, he relies on positive relationships, diligence, and patience to surmount obstacles. What drives Mr. Steer to persevere in his vocation is a profound love for teaching, coupled with a deep-seated belief in its transformative power. His mantra—work hard, be kind, and relish the journey—serves as a guiding beacon, shaping his interactions with students and fostering a nurturing learning environment. In the corridors of academia, Mr. Steer is more than a teacher; he's a mentor, a guide, and a beacon of inspiration. Some may call him Mr. Steer, others prefer the moniker Mr. J, but to all, he remains a paragon of coolness and wisdom, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of his students.</p>

            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p>I bring <strong>7 years</strong> of experience to the classroom, using innovative methods to make math accessible and enjoyable. My teaching philosophy centres on providing each student with an optimal level of challenge. I offer a variety of tasks, categorised into Red, Amber, and Green levels. Students have the autonomy to choose their work, with Red tasks being straightforward, Amber tasks requiring thoughtful consideration, and Green tasks demanding focused effort and critical thinking. This approach ensures that every student is engaged at their own level and encourages growth and development across all abilities.</p>
