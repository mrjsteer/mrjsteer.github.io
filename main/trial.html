            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Mr Steer is a dedicated teacher with a passion for maths, economics, and business studies. Since March 2024, he has taught in five schools across the globe. Some students affectionately call him Mr. Steer, while others prefer the nickname "Mr. J." His teaching journey began when he started helping younger students while still in school. He found joy in teaching, especially in maths, which came naturally to him. Moving from one school to another has been an exciting adventure for Mr. Steer, allowing him to experience different cultures and teaching methods. His favourite colour is blue, and when it comes to dessert, he can never resist a stack of fluffy pancakes. For drinks, a strawberry milkshake always hits the spot. If he's dining out, you'll likely find him at Al Shofra in Salmiya, Kuwait â€“ their cuisine is unbeatable. Italy holds a special place in his heart due to its incredible food culture. As for maths jokes, 'Why was 6 afraid of 7? Because 7 ate 9' always gets him. Solving equations tops his list of favourite maths lessons. When it comes to GBA events, he's all about Sports Day and the Maths Academia Cup!</p>
