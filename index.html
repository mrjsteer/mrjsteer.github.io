    <meta name="description" content="Mr Steer's official website built by one of his students from GBA Kuwait. This website is purposely made to support Mr Steer, previously a tiktoker who used to make hilariously funny videos but got locked out of his account, to gain back his popularity although he never really asked for it this was more like a passion project. Hope you enjoy it! Please don't copy or attempt to steal as we all know the official website URL cannot be changed. Thank you!">
